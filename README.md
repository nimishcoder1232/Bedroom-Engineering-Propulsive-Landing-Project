# Bedroom-Engineering-Propulsive-Landing-Project
This repo has everything that I made for my rocket that can propulsive landing, while still being under ITAR restrictions. 

For this project, I will design a rocket that can launch and then do a propulsive landing. In order to meet this challenge, I will have to make a new custom ESP32-based flight computer. I will have to make a quaternion orientation calculation system, I will have to design a control loop, and I will have to make a simulator in Python, without vibe coding, because it is too complicated. The simulator will simulate the rocket’s flight to help tune the control loop and the propulsive landing.

I did this project for a few reasons. The first reason I did it, is because in gneral, this is my passion. I love both engineering and rockets, so this is satisfactory for me. This isant a project for me, this project is more, who I am. I also made this project to learn from it. Throughout this project, I have learned sooo much, PCB design, CAD, Programign in many languages, soldering. And SO much more. Every time I sit down to do one of these projects, I end up learning so much. That is the second reason I work on these projects, To learn From them. 

Notes:
I am 3d printing everything myself, I DONT need reinbursment
Anything thats NOT in the cad, is provided by me. (THe engines and the big DC motor
are in the cad, but I am providing those) 
This BOM only has the stuff, I CANT provide myself.
